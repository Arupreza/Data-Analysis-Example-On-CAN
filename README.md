In recent years, IoT devices have drawn attentionto big data, complicating connectivity, and daily dataprocessing. The automotive sector is no exception. The right wayof vehicle data analysis is becoming essential every day fordetecting internal errors, protecting against attackers, andconnected vehicle concepts such as V2X. Some researchers useraw data to secure CAN, but that's not enough. On the otherhand, deep learning is essential to secure autonomous drivingand CAN, and data labeling is an obstacle. So, data analysisplayed an important role in data labeling. There are major flawsin data analysis, feature extraction, and data labeling for in-vehicle networks. Therefore, we proposed a CAN messageanalysis tool concept that can provide deep label analysis resultsand new features. There are many data analysis techniquesthese days, and we are trying to include suitable CAN messageanalysis techniques in our tool concept.
